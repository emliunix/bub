# Bub Docs

Bub is built for day-to-day coding tasks: run commands, edit files, debug failures, and keep progress visible across long sessions.

## What You Can Expect

- Clear command behavior: only lines that start with `,` are commands.
- One execution path: the same rules apply to both your input and assistant-generated commands.
- Graceful recovery: failed commands are fed back to the model with structured context.
- Trackable sessions: tape, anchors, and handoff help you resume work cleanly.

## How Bub Behaves In Practice

1. Type normal text to ask the assistant.
2. Start a line with `,` to run a command.
3. Known names such as `,help` are internal commands.
4. Other comma-prefixed lines are treated as shell commands.
5. If a command fails, Bub keeps going and uses the error context in the next model step.
