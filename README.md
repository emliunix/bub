> Bub it. Build it.

Bub is a coding agent CLI built on `republic`.
It is designed for real engineering workflows where execution must be predictable, inspectable, and recoverable.

## Four Things To Know

1. Command boundary is strict: only lines starting with `,` are treated as commands.
2. The same routing model is applied to both user input and assistant output.
3. Successful commands return directly; failed commands fall back to the model with structured context.
4. Session context is append-only tape with explicit `anchor/handoff` transitions.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psiace/bub.git
cd bub
uv sync
cp env.example .env
```

Minimal `.env`:

```bash
BUB_AGENT_MODEL=openrouter:qwen/qwen3-coder-next
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Start interactive CLI:

```bash
uv run bub
```

## Interaction Rules

- `hello`: natural language routed to model.
- `,help`: internal command.
- `,git status`: shell command.
- `, ls -la`: shell command (space after comma is optional).

Common commands:

```text
,help
,tools
,tool.describe name=fs.read
,skills.list
,skills.describe name=friendly-python
,handoff name=phase-1 summary="bootstrap done"
,anchors
,tape.info
,tape.search query=error
,tape.reset archive=true
,quit
```

## Telegram (Optional)

```bash
BUB_BUS_TELEGRAM_ENABLED=true
BUB_BUS_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456:token
BUB_BUS_TELEGRAM_ALLOW_FROM=["123456789","your_username"]
uv run bub telegram
```
